## Description of Notebook

The notebook contains an explanation of a number of features of the numpy.random package:

- Simple random data
- Permutations
- The purpose of five Distribution functions
  - Uniform
  - Normal
  - Weibull
  - Binomial
  - Multinomial
  - The use of seeds in generating pseudo-random numbers
  
It explains each feature and the functions contained in each using code, plots, and diagrams where required. 

Use of the notebook requires the following Python packages to be initalised:

- numpy.random
- matplotlib.pyplot

In addition, a Generator needs to be constructed. 

At the time of writing this README and the notebook, the most recent release of numpy.random is 1.21.0. This contents of the notebook are based on this release.

All references are provided in Section 6 of the notebook.
